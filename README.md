# OpenCV Concepts Project: Face Detection, Image Augmentation, Color & Shape Detection
 - OpenCV concepts using C++

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of various computer vision concepts using OpenCV in C++. The project covers fundamental techniques such as face detection, image augmentation, color detection, and shape detection. It serves as a practical example of how to leverage OpenCV's capabilities to perform different tasks on images and videos.

## Installation
Install OpenCV: Make sure you have OpenCV installed on your system. You can follow the official installation guide here.

## Face Detection
The face detection module uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in images or video streams. It identifies regions of interest (ROIs) where faces are present and highlight them.

## Image Augmentation
Image augmentation techniques are applied to input images to generate variations. Techniques such as rotation, flipping, resizing, and adding noise are used to create a diverse dataset for training machine learning models.

## Color Detection
The color detection module identifies specific colors in images or video frames. By setting color ranges in the HSV color space, the program detects pixels that fall within the specified range and highlights them.

## Shape Detection
Shape detection identifies and outlines different shapes present in images. The Canny edge detection algorithm is applied to locate edges, and then contours are extracted to determine the shapes.
